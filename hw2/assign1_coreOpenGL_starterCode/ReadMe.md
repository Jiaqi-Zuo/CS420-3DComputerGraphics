## Core Credit Features

- Uses OpenGL core profile, version 3.2 or higher

- Completed all basic levels to render the coaster

- Rendered the camera at a reasonable speed in a continuous path/orientation

- Run at interactive frame rate (>15fps at 1280 x 720)

## Aditional Features

- Render a T-shaped rail cross section

- Render a Double Rail

- Texture-mapped wooden crossbars

- Render a sky-box 

### Keyboard/Mouse controls:
- 'A' for starting taking 1000 screenshots
- 'p' for starting/pausing the ride
